rcvr is a tiny utility written in C for libcurl[1] easy handle pooling.

It's shamelessly inspired from libzdb[2], a database connection pool library.

Also, it's still *work in progress* & undocumented!

Re-cycling the same easy handle is a recommended practice[3]:

  After each single curl_easy_perform(3) operation, libcurl
  will keep the connection alive and open. A subsequent req-
  -uest using the same easy handle to the same host might
  just be able to use the already open connection! This red-
  -uces network impact a lot.

Here the goal is to make it easy for a developer to reuse easy handles, especia-
-lly when dealing with multiple threads: see this discussion[4].
